👋 Hi, I’m Mayur Bedare

Java-Centric Full-Stack Developer | Microservices | Cloud-Native Systems

I am Mayur Bedare, a dedicated Software Developer with a Post Graduate Diploma in Advanced Computing (PG-DAC) from Sunbeam Institute of Information Technology, Pune. I specialize in Java-centric full-stack development, focusing on designing scalable, secure, and production-ready applications.

My core strength lies in building distributed systems using modern backend frameworks, secure API design, and cloud-native deployment practices.

🧠 Technical Expertise
🔹 Backend & Architecture

Java 21, Spring Boot

Secure REST API Design

Spring Security (JWT, RBAC)

Microservices-Inspired Architecture

Asynchronous Communication (Apache Kafka)

🔹 Frontend

React

Redux Toolkit

SPA Architecture

🔹 Polyglot Services

Node.js (Express) – Catalog & Search Services

.NET (C#) – Centralized Logging Services

🔹 DevOps & Cloud-Native

Docker – Containerization

Kubernetes – Service orchestration & horizontal scaling

Jenkins – CI/CD automation

📚 Featured Project: Bookstack
The Modern Library Platform

Microservices • Polyglot • Cloud-Native

Bookstack is a scalable, feature-rich library management platform engineered using a polyglot microservices architecture. It is designed to handle real-world scale, fault tolerance, and secure transactions.

🏗️ Architecture Highlights

Spring Cloud Gateway as a centralized entry point

Spring Boot Core Services for memberships, rentals, and fine calculations

Node.js Catalog Service for advanced book search and trending algorithms

Apache Kafka for event-driven async communication

.NET Logging Service for centralized log management

React + Redux Toolkit frontend with optimistic UI

🔐 Security & Payments

JWT-based Authentication & Authorization

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Secure Payment Flow (Server-side order creation + HMAC verification)

☸️ Deployment

Fully containerized using Docker

Deployed on Kubernetes with horizontal scaling

CI/CD pipelines automated using Jenkins

📌 Bookstack reflects my ability to design end-to-end distributed systems, integrate multiple technologies, and apply industry-grade backend and DevOps practices.

🎯 What I Care About

Clean architecture & maintainable code

Secure and scalable backend systems

Real-world problem solving

Continuous learning and engineering depth

I aim to contribute to high-impact engineering teams that value performance, security, and system design excellence.
